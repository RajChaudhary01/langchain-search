# Project Readme

This repository contains code to integrate with the OpenAI API using the LangChain library. The code creates a simple demo application using Streamlit to interact with the OpenAI API for natural language processing.

## Getting Started

To run this code, you will need Python installed on your machine. You will also need to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, you need to set up your environment variables. Make sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```dotenv
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=test
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Replace `<your_api_key>` with your actual API key for the OpenAI API.

## Usage

After setting up the environment variables, you can run the code using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start a local server, and you can access the demo application in your web browser.

## Code Overview

The code consists of the following components:

- `main.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the Streamlit application code. It prompts the user to enter a question and then invokes the OpenAI API to get a response.
- `langchain_community`: This module provides the `Ollama` class, which is used to interact with the LangChain library and the OpenAI API.
- `langchain_core`: This module contains utility functions and classes for working with LangChain.
- `langsmith`: This module provides wrappers and utilities for natural language processing tasks.
- `.env`: This file contains environment variables required for the application to run, including the OpenAI API key.
